#SCALDama
**Introduction**
SCALDama is a digital recreation of the classic game of Italian Checkers, developed as a final project for the "Paradigmi di Programmazione e Sviluppo" course.
The application allows two players to compete in hotseat mode (locally on the same device) or against a dedicated AI player. The project focuses on clean architectural design using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and functional programming principles in Scala 3.

Key Features
Full Ruleset: Complete implementation of Italian checkers rules, including mandatory captures.

AI Mode: Challenge the computer with a dedicated movement logic.

Undo System: Easily revert your moves (one move in PvP, two moves in PvAI).

Graphical Interface: A clean and intuitive GUI built with Scala Swing.
